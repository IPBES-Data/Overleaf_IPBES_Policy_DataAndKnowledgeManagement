\section{Preamble}

The \gls{plenary} of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), in section II of its decision IPBES-2/5, established a \textit{task force} on knowledge and data for the period of its first work programme 2014‒2018. In decision IPBES-3/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} approved the data and information management plan set out in annex II to the same decision. At its seventh session, in decision IPBES-7/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} adopted the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, which included among its six objectives objective 3 (a), advanced work \textit{on knowledge and data}. In section IV of its decision IPBES-7/1, the \textit{Plenary }recalled the establishment of the \textit{task force} and extended its mandate for the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, in accordance with the revised terms of reference set out in annex II to the same decision, and requested the \gls{bureau} and \gls{mep}, through the \textit{IPBES secretariat} to constitute the \textit{task force} in accordance with the terms of reference. According to its terms of reference, the \textit{task force} on knowledge and data oversees and takes part in the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme up to 2030 and acts in accordance with relevant decisions by the \gls{plenary} and its subsidiary bodies. Its mandate includes, among other things, to guide the \textit{secretariat}, including the dedicated \textit{technical support unit}, in the management of the \textit{data}, information and knowledge used in \gls{IPBES products}, including the development of the web-based infrastructure, to ensure their long-term availability and data interoperability. The purpose of the policy is to provide overarching guidance on the management of data and
knowledge to current and upcoming assessments and the work of task forces regarding IPBES products. The
policy is grounded in the principles of open science, \textit{accessibility}, and building knowledge through
partnerships.

\section{Introduction}

This policy builds on the data and information management plan approved by the \textit{IPBES Plenary} set out in annex II to decision IPBES-3/1, and the earlier revision of the IPBES data and knowledge management policy
welcomed by the IPBES Plenary at its 9th session, set out in IPBES/9/INF/14, appendix II to the annex. It builds
in particular on the activity “reviewing and developing data and metadata guidelines”, and is grounded in its
principles for “managing knowledge, information, and data” in the Platform, in particular accessibility, and
open science. Definitions of the terms used throughout this document can be found in the appendix to this
policy.



\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open science}. The open science approach promotes the generation of \textit{knowledge }through collaboration based on free and open access to \textit{knowledge}, information, and \textit{data}. Open science, therefore, ensures that the work of all the \textit{experts} and \textit{stakeholders} involved is fully recognized, properly attributed, documented, and preserved. Adoption of these principles and of this approach means a significant cultural change in the ways in which science is done and scientific results and underlying \textit{data} are shared publicly by authors, journals and research organizations and thus made relevant to society. In the context of the Platform, the open science approach could engender very significant advances in \textit{data} integration, analysis and interpretation and could lead to a better understanding of nature and its contribution to a good quality of life. Two key aspects of open science are “\textit{accessibility}” and “inclusivity and \textit{collective benefit}”.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility.} A core value of the Platform is free and open access to its deliverables and to the material on which they are based. Consequently, the policy will aim for open, sustained access to \textit{data} and information sources for its deliverables (e.g., in the scientific literature) with as few restrictions as possible; emphasise the need to make data and knowledge available;  and facilitate multilingual discovery and sharing of \textit{data} and knowledge wherever possible. The Platform acknowledges that making \textit{data} and information accessible may not always mean it is always accessible to all IPBES members and\textit{ stakeholders}, including Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), as technical, economical, political or any other reasons may limit \textit{accessibility}, but not its findability.
    \item \textbf{Inclusivity and }\textit{\textbf{collective benefit}}\textbf{.} Cooperation in \textit{research} and broad acceptance of the resulting \gls{ipbesproducts} is essential for the Platform to fulfil its mandate. For the acceptance and cooperation of \textit{stakeholders} and \textit{data and knowledge holders}, inclusivity in all stages of the \textit{research} is essential, and IPBES takes many steps to try to enhance participation beyond only scientific researchers. IPBES acknowledges the richness of diverse knowledge systems and epistemologies and diversity of knowledge holders and producers, including \textit{Indigenous and local knowledge} (ILK) and \textit{IPLCs}; also outlined in the \gls{unescoopenscience}.
\end{itemize}

Thus, \textit{data and knowledge }management within IPBES should be based on UNEP’s over-arching strategies, policies and guidelines, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, allowing IPBES members and \textit{stakeholders}, \textit{IPLCs} and other interested parties to use and access \gls{ipbesproducts}, and \textit{knowledge and data} gathered or documented during their production and consequently derive benefit from them. IPBES has recognised the importance of \textit{ILK} to the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems, and the procedures and protocols to be used with regard to ILK and IPLCs have been developed in detail. From its inception, the Platform aims to enhance inter-relationships and complementarities between different knowledge systems.

\section{Objectives}

To fulfil its function to generate transparent assessments, IPBES is committed to implementing \textit{data and knowledge} management procedures that are discipline-appropriate, practical, cost-effective and sustainable, and supportive of its objectives. The data and knowledge management policy is the primary reference document for IPBES \textit{data and knowledge }management\textit{.} It serves to ensure that \textit{data and knowledge} is managed correctly and consistently, and is maintained to the highest possible standard. The data and knowledge management policy has the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item To ensure that \textit{data and knowledge} produced during IPBES \textit{research }activities, within as well as between assessments, follow the \textit{FAIR }and \textit{CARE principles to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform};
    
    \item To ensure that \gls{ipbesproducts}, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, are openly available and designed so they are accessible; allowing all scientists, IPBES members, \textit{IPLCs} and other \textit{stakeholders} to use them and consequently derive and share the benefits from them;

    \item To give full consideration to existing and evolving principles and guidelines for the applicability and
    ethical and responsible use of \textit{AI} and advances in data technology;

    \item To provide guidance to all IPBES entities, including \textit{secretariat} and \textit{experts}, to fulfil their
    responsibilities with respect to management, handling, preservation, and distribution of \textit{data and
    knowledge} and \textit{generated data} within the Platform;
    
    \item To guide the \textit{experts }to fulfil their responsibilities to develop the necessary \textit{data and knowledge management reports }which fulfil the requirements of this policy;
    
    \item To provide a suggested \textit{workflow} for long-term storage and preservation of \gls{ipbesproducts} to the \textit{experts};
    
    \item To promote the usage of open-source software to enable users to recreate and use \gls{ipbesproducts} without limitations.
\end{enumerate}


\section{General Principles}

To the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, \gls{ipbesproducts} and associated \textit{research} should be managed following the \textit{FAIR and CARE principles} throughout their life cycle in line with the commitment to open science and accessibility.

\gls{ipbesproducts} and associated \textit{research} relating to \textit{IPLCs} or incorporating \textit{Indigenous and local knowledge}, will follow IPBES’s approach to recognising and working with \textit{Indigenous and local knowledge }(Annex II to decision IPBES-5/1).

\gls{ipbesproducts} which follow the \textit{FAIR }and\textit{ CARE }principles \textit{to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform} are essential for fulfilling the functions of IPBES, to perform regular and timely assessments of \textit{knowledge} on nature, its contribution to good quality of life, and their interlinkages, in a transparent and \textit{reproducible} manner.

In the management, handling, and delivery of \gls{ipbesproducts}, international, regional, and national law should be complied with, which includes \textit{access and benefit-sharing}, sovereign rights over genetic resources, rights of privacy, intellectual property rights, \textit{data} governance regulations, and duties of confidentiality as well as other legal obligations to which IPBES has agreed as binding upon IPBES and that fall outside the scope of this policy. \gls{ipbesproducts} should be anonymized, if necessary, before long-term storage and publication.

IPBES experts are encouraged to take advantage of advances in \gls{data} technologies and to make best use of these advances in the preparation of \gls{ipbesproducts}. These technologies should be used responsibly, with particular attention to ethics, transparency and underlying biases. The use of \gls{ai} within IPBES should be precautionary, following the Principles for the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in the United Nations System and the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artifiical Intelligence.

IPBES is committed to providing guidance to all IPBES \textit{experts} to ensure that they are aware of and follow IPBES procedures, which aim to follow the \textit{FAIR and CARE principles} and respoinsible use of advances in \textit{data} technologies to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform.

\section{Application}

IPBES will apply this \textit{data} and \textit{knowledge} management policy to all new and ongoing \gls{ipbesproducts} and related \textit{research}. The policy should be reviewed at least every 2 years by the \textit{task force }on \textit{data and knowledge management} to adapt to new developments in these principles, taking full account of existing and evolving principles and guidelines on the applicability and ethical use of advances in \textit{data} technology. Exceptions and deviations to this policy have to be agreed upon with the \texit{secretariat} and the \textit{technical support unit} on \textit{data} and \textit{knowledge} management and documented in the corresponding \textit{data and knowledge management report}.

\section{Scope}

This policy applies to all \gls{ipbesproducts}. \textit{IPBES experts }are required to abide by the terms and conditions agreed with third parties. IPBES also recognises that such third parties’ policies are evolving and that the latter may require higher levels of \textit{data accessibility} and dissemination in the future.

\section{Compliance and enforcement}

Compliance with the data and knowledge management policy is mandatory for all IPBES entities involved in the preparation of the \gls{ipbesproducts}. Compliance will be monitored by the \textit{technical support unit} on data and knowledge management. \textit{Products} will not be accepted as \gls{ipbesproducts} unless they comply with this policy.

    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Provisions on \textit{data and knowledge} management reporting}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textit{data and knowledge management report} is expected for each IPBES \textit{research project}. This can be achieved by a single \textit{data and knowledge management report} for an entire \textit{research project} or by an seperate \textit{data and knowledge management reports} for each \textit{research} aspect, such as an analysis or dhe development of one figure, within a \textit{research project};

    \item The \textit{data and knowledge management report} can consist of the report and if applicable multiple additional documents. When it contains multiple documents, the actual \textit{data and knowledge management report}, the main document, can be considered an overview document which provides transparency of the methods, with the additional documents providing more technical background for \textit{reproducibility}.

    \item The \textit{data and knowledge} management should comply with this policy. If this is not possible, the exceptions and justifications need to be specified in the \textit{data and knowledge management report} and be approved by the \textit{technical support unit} on data and knowledge;

    \item It is the responsibility of the \textit{experts} to ensure that the \textit{data and knowledge management report} is created, maintained, and updated throughout the \textit{research project} life cycle and submitted to the associated \textit{technical support unit} in time for its first \textit{milestone};

    \item The \textit{technical support unit} on \textit{data} and \textit{knowledge} provides support, and where appropriate guidelines and examples (\textit{data and knowledge management report template}), to the \textit{experts} to make sure that \textit{FAIR} and \textit{CARE principles} are followed, within the mandate of the Platform, for \textit{data and knowledge} management and documented in \textit{data and knowledge management reports}. This includes the use of open formats suitable for long-term storage and retrieval, reusability and interoperability of \textit{data};

    \item The \textit{task force} and \textit{technical support unit on Indigenous and local knowledge} provide support, and where appropriate, guidelines and examples, to the \textit{experts }to make sure that \textit{FAIR} and \textit{CARE principles} are followed, to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, for \textit{data and knowledge} management and documented in \textit{data and knowledge management reports}, where such \textit{data} relates to \textit{Indigenous and local knowledge} or \textit{IPLCs};

    \item The IPBES \textit{secretariat} provides information about recommended long-term, and to the extent possible certified, open \textit{data} repositories which provide \textit{DOIs}.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Provisions on accessibility, inclusivity, and \textit{collective benefit}}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \gls{ipbesproducts} should be preserved including a \gls{DOI} for each \textit{milestone }of an IPBES \textit{research project};

    \item \gls{ipbesproducts} in or associated with an assessment or other \gls{ipbesproducts}, including \textit{data and knowledge management reports}, should be made openly \textit{accessible} in a form that follows this policy at the latest one calendar month after the approval/acceptance of the assessment, or approval or acknowledgement of other \textit{IPBES product} by the \gls{plenary}. \gls{dataandknowledge} related to \textit{milestones} should also be made \textit{accessible}, as far as confidentiality rules allow for this. Embargo periods are possible but need to be approved by the \textit{task force on data and knowledge management}. Restricted access to the IPBES \textit{data} underlying \gls{ipbesproducts} is only allowed under special circumstances and needs to be approved by the \textit{technical support unit} on \textit{data} and \textit{knowledge} management;

    \item Applicable legal, ethical, privacy and confidentiality, and \textit{data} governance requirements need to be followed and \textit{generated data}, if deemed necessary, anonymised before preservation;

    \item Tools for the finding, processing and final presentation of any \textit{data} should be used in a responsible and ethical manner which is following this policy. No tools should be used without critical assessment of the methods and results;

    \item The management, handling, and delivery of the materials from \textit{IPLCs} adhere to the \textit{FAIR }and \textit{CARE principles} to the fullest extent possible as outlined in this policy, as well as to other binding conditions outside this policy in accordance with international, regional, and national law;

    \item \gls{ipbesproducts} and their metadata are released with a clear and \textit{accessible data} use license: allowed licenses for the \gls{ipbesproducts} are Creative Commons By Attribution (CC-BY) or licenses equivalent to these, which permits users to copy, distribute and transmit work, adapt work under the condition that the user must attribute the work in the manner specified by IPBES. Divergent licences need to be approved by the \textit{technical support unit} on \textit{data} and \textit{knowledge} management;

    \item All \textit{research} within IPBES has to be conducted in accordance with agreements with the holders of the \textit{knowledge and data }regarding use, reuse, presentation, and procedures. Communication with \textit{IPLCs} needs to be maintained over the whole \textit{research} cycle to the extent possible within the mandate of the Platform and IPBES’ mandate to provide feedback to the \textit{knowledge} holders as well as include feedback from the \textit{knowledge} holders in the \textit{research}, as outlined in the IPBES approach to recognising and working with \textit{Indigenous and local knowledge} as set out in annex II to decision IPBES-5/1;

    \item \gls{ipbesproducts} will be made available and \textit{accessible} to the holders of the \textit{knowledge and data}, in line with agreed terms documented during ILK dialogue workshops or other activities, with due consideration to \textit{FAIR and CARE principles}.
