\section{Preamble}

The \gls{plenary} of the \gls{ipbes}, in section II of its decision IPBES-2/5, established a \gls{tf} on knowledge and data for the period of its first work programme 2014‒2018. In decision IPBES-3/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} approved the data and information management plan set out in annex II to the same decision. At its seventh session, in decision IPBES-7/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} adopted the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, which included among its six objectives objective 3 (a), advanced work on knowledge and data. In section IV of its decision IPBES-7/1, the \gls{plenary} recalled the establishment of the \gls{tf} and extended its mandate for the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, in accordance with the revised terms of reference set out in annex II to the same decision, and requested the \gls{bureau} and \gls{mep}, through the \gls{secretariat} to constitute the \gls{tf} in accordance with the terms of reference. According to its terms of reference, the \gls{tf} on knowledge and data oversees and takes part in the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme up to 2030 and acts in accordance with relevant decisions by the \gls{plenary} and its subsidiary bodies. Its mandate includes, among other things, to guide the \gls{secretariat}, including the dedicated \gls{tsu} in the management of the \gls{data}, information and \gls{knowledge} used in \glspl{ipbesproduct}, including the development of the web-based infrastructure, to ensure their long-term availability, reusability and data interoperability. The purpose of the policy is to provide overarching guidance on the management of data and knowledge to current and upcoming assessments and the work of task forces regarding \glspl{ipbesproduct}. The policy is grounded in the principles of open science, \textit{accessibility}, and building knowledge through partnerships.accessibility

\section{Introduction}

This policy builds on the data and information management plan approved by the IPBES \gls{plenary} set out in annex II to decision IPBES-3/1, and the earlier revision of the IPBES data and knowledge management policy welcomed by the IPBES Plenary at its 9th session, set out in IPBES/9/INF/14, appendix II to the annex. It builds in particular on the activity "reviewing and developing data and metadata guidelines", and is grounded in its principles for "managing knowledge, information, and data" in the Platform, in particular accessibility, and open science.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open science}. The open science approach promotes the generation of \gls{knowledge} through collaboration based on free and open access to \gls{knowledge}, information, and \gls{data}. Open science, therefore, ensures that the work of all the \glspl{ipbesexpert} and \glspl{stakeholder} involved is fully recognised, properly attributed, documented, and preserved. Adoption of the open science approach and principles means a significant cultural change in the ways in which science is done, and scientific results and underlying \gls{data} are shared publicly by authors, journals and research organisations and thus made relevant to society. In the context of the Platform, the open science approach brings very significant advances in \gls{data} integration, analysis and interpretation and could ultimately lead to a better understanding of nature and its contribution to a good quality of life. Two key aspects of open science are "\textit{accessibility}" and "inclusivity and \gls{collectivebenefit}".

    \item \textbf{Accessibility.} A core value of the Platform is free and open access to its deliverables and to the material on which they are based. Consequently, the policy will aim for open, sustained access to \gls{data} and information sources for its deliverables (e.g., in the scientific literature) with as few restrictions as possible; enforce the use of common and \gls{accessible}, non-propriaraty file formats in the Platform's deliverables; emphasise the need to make data and knowledge available;  and facilitate multilingual discovery and sharing of \gls{data} and \gls{knowledge} wherever possible. The Platform acknowledges that making \gls{data} and information \gls{accessible} may not always mean it is always \gls{accessible} to all IPBES members and\glspl{stakeholder}, including \glspl{iplc}, as technical, economical, political or any other reasons may limit accessibility, but not its findability.
    
    \item \textbf{Inclusivity and \gls{collectivebenefit}.} Cooperation in \gls{knowledgesynthesis} and broad acceptance of the resulting \glspl{ipbesproduct} is essential for the Platform to fulfil its mandate. For the acceptance and cooperation of \glspl{stakeholder} and \gls{dataandknowledge} holders, inclusivity in all stages of the \gls{knowledgesynthesis} is essential, and IPBES takes many steps to try to enhance participation beyond only scientific researchers. IPBES acknowledges the richness of diverse knowledge systems and epistemologies and diversity of knowledge holders and producers, including \gls{ilk} and \glspl{iplc}; also outlined in the \gls{unescoopenscience}\footnote{\href{https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation}{https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation}}.

    \item \textbf{Responsible and ethical use of advances in data technologies}. The ethical and responsible use of advances in data technologies, in particular \gls{ai}, ensures the appropriate use of these technologies and fosters trust in the Platform. The use of \gls{ai} should be grounded in transparency, accountability, fairness and respect for human rights and diverse knowledge systems. The values of inclusivity, accessibility and \gls{collectivebenefit} should guide the use of \gls{ai}. This approach supports the equitable advancement of knowledge and ensures that the use of \gls{ai} benefits \glspl{ipbesproduct} following this policy.
\end{itemize}

Thus, this policy follows regarding \gls{dataandknowledge} management within IPBES the UNEP’s over-arching strategies, policies and guidelines \footnote{\href{https://www.unep.org/about-un-environment/policies-and-strategies}{https://www.unep.org/about-un-environment/policies-and-strategies}}, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, allowing IPBES members and \glspl{stakeholder}, \glspl{iplc} and other interested parties to use and access \glspl{ipbesproduct}, and \gls{data} gathered or documented during their production and consequently derive benefit from them. IPBES has recognised the importance of \gls{ilk} to the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems, and the procedures and protocols to be used with regard to \gls{ilk} and \glspl{iplc} have been developed in detail. From its inception, the Platform aims to enhance inter-relationships and complementarities between different knowledge systems.

\section{Objectives}

To fulfil its function to generate transparent assessments, IPBES is committed to implementing \gls{dataandknowledge} management procedures that are discipline-appropriate, practical, cost-effective and sustainable, and supportive of its objectives. This data and knowledge management policy is the primary reference document for IPBES \gls{dataandknowledge} management. It serves to ensure that \gls{dataandknowledge} is managed correctly and consistently, and is maintained to the highest possible standard. The data and knowledge management policy has the following objectives:


\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item To ensure that \gls{dataandknowledge} produced during IPBES \gls{knowledgesynthesis} activities follow legal obligations and the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform;
    
    \item To ensure that \glspl{ipbesproduct}, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, are openly available and designed so they are accessible; allowing all scientists, IPBES members, \glspl{iplc} and other \glspl{stakeholder} to use them and consequently derive and share the benefits from them;

    \item To give full consideration to existing and evolving principles and guidelines for the applicability and ethical and responsible use of advances in data technology including \gls{ai};

    \item To provide guidance to all \glspl{entity}, including \gls{secretariat} and \glspl{ipbesexpert}, to fulfil their responsibilities with respect to management, handling, preservation, and distribution of \gls{dataandknowledge}, generated \gls{data}, and \glspl{ipbesproduct} within the Platform;
    
    \item To provide a suggested \gls{workflow} for long-term storage and preservation of \glspl{ipbesproduct} to the \glspl{ipbesexpert};
    
    \item To promote the usage of open-source software to enable users to recreate and use \glspl{ipbesproduct} without limitations.

    \item To guide the \glspl{ipbesexpert} to fulfil their responsibilities to develop the necessary \glspl{dmr} which fulfil the requirements of this policy;
\end{enumerate}


\section{General Principles}

To the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, \glspl{ipbesproduct} and the associated \gls{knowledgesynthesis} should be managed following the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles throughout their life cycle in line with the commitment to open science and accessibility.

\glspl{ipbesproduct} and associated \gls{knowledgesynthesis} relating to \glspl{iplc} or incorporating \gls{ilk}, will follow the \gls{ipbes} approach to recognising and working with \gls{ilk} (Annex II to decision IPBES-5/1).

\glspl{ipbesproduct} which follow the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform are essential for fulfilling the functions of \gls{ipbes}; to perform regular and timely assessments of \gls{knowledge} on nature, its contribution to good quality of life, and their interlinkages, in a transparent and \textit{reproducible} manner.

In the management, handling, and delivery of \glspl{ipbesproduct}, international, regional, and national law should be complied with, which includes \gls{accessbenefitsharing}, sovereign rights over genetic resources, rights of privacy, intellectual property rights, \gls{data} governance regulations, and duties of confidentiality as well as other legal obligations to which IPBES has agreed as binding upon IPBES and that fall outside the scope of this policy. \glspl{ipbesproduct} should be anonymised, if necessary, before long-term storage and publication.

IPBES experts are encouraged to take advantage of advances in \gls{data} technologies and to make best use of these advances in the preparation of \glspl{ipbesproduct}. These technologies should be used responsibly, with particular attention to ethics, transparency and underlying biases. The use of \gls{ai} within IPBES should be precautionary, following the Principles for the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in the United Nations System\footnote{\href{https://unsceb.org/principles-ethical-use-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-system }{https://unsceb.org/principles-ethical-use-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-system }} and the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artifical Intelligence\footnote{\href{https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence }{https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence }}.

IPBES is committed to providing guidance to all IPBES \glspl{ipbesexpert} to ensure that they are aware of and follow IPBES procedures, which aim to follow the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles and responsible use of advances in \gls{data} technologies to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform.

\section{Application}

IPBES will apply this \gls{data} and \gls{knowledge} management policy to all new and ongoing \glspl{ipbesproduct} and related \gls{knowledgesynthesis}. The policy should be reviewed at least every 2 years by the \gls{tf} on \gls{dataandknowledge} management to adapt to new developments in these principles, taking full account of existing and evolving principles and guidelines on the applicability and ethical use of advances in \gls{data} technology. Exceptions and deviations to this policy have to be agreed upon with the \gls{secretariat} and the \gls{tsu} on \gls{dataandknowledge} management and documented in the corresponding \gls{dmr}.

\section{Scope}

This policy applies to all \glspl{ipbesproduct}. \glspl{ipbesexpert} are required to abide by the terms and conditions agreed with third parties. IPBES also recognises that such third parties’ policies are evolving and that these may require higher levels of \gls{data} accessibility and dissemination in the future.

\section{Compliance and enforcement}

Compliance with the data and knowledge management policy is mandatory for all \glspl{entity} involved in the preparation of the \glspl{ipbesproduct}. Compliance will be monitored by the \gls{tsu} on \gls{dataandknowledge} management. Products will not be accepted as \glspl{ipbesproduct} unless they comply with this policy. 
The roles and responsibilities for the implementation of this policy and the production of \glspl{ipbesproduct} compliant and within all \glspl{task} are distributed among all \glspl{entity} according to their roles. The detailed roles and responsibilities are outlined in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_roles}.

\section{Provisions on Data and Knowledge Management Reporting}


\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A \gls{dmr} is expected for each \gls{task}. This can be achieved by a single \gls{dmr} covering all the analyses and work for an entire \gls{task} or by seperate \glspl{dmr} for each sub-\gls{task}, such as an analysis or the development of one figure, within a \glspl{task};

    \item The \gls{dmr} can consist of the report and if applicable multiple additional documents. When it contains multiple documents, the actual \gls{dmr}, the main document, can be considered an overview document which provides transparency of the methods, with the additional documents providing more technical background for \textit{reproducibility}.

    \item The \gls{dataandknowledge} management should comply with this policy. If this is not possible, exceptions and justifications need to be specified in the \gls{dmr} and be approved by the \gls{tsu} on data and knowledge;

    \item It is the responsibility of the \glspl{ipbesexpert} to ensure that the \gls{dmr} is created, maintained, and updated throughout the life cycle of the \gls{task} and submitted to the associated \gls{tsu} in time for its first \gls{milestone};

    \item The  \gls{tsu} on \gls{dataandknowledge} provides support and, where appropriate guidelines and examples (\gls{dmr}  template), to the \glspl{ipbesexpert} to make sure that \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles are followed, within the mandate of the Platform, for \gls{dataandknowledge} management and documentation in the \glspl{dmr}. This includes the use of open file formats suitable for long-term storage and retrieval, reusability and interoperability of the \gls{data};

    \item The \gls{tf} and \gls{tsu} on \gls{ilk} provide support and, where appropriate guidelines and examples, to the \glspl{ipbesexpert} to make sure that the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles are followed, to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, for \gls{dataandknowledge} management and documentation in the \glspl{dmr}, where such \gls{data} relates to \gls{ilk} or \glspl{iplc};

    \item The IPBES \gls{secretariat} provides information about recommended long-term, and to the extent possible certified, open \gls{data} repositories which provide \glspl{doi}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Provisions on accessibility, inclusivity, and Collective Benefit}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \glspl{ipbesproduct} should be preserved including a \gls{doi} for each \gls{milestone} of a \gls{task};

    \item \glspl{ipbesproduct} in or associated with an assessment or other \glspl{ipbesproduct}, including \glspl{dmr}, should be made openly \gls{accessible} in a form that follows this policy at the latest one calendar month after the approval/acceptance of the assessment, or approval or acknowledgement of other \glspl{ipbesproduct} by the \gls{plenary}. \gls{dataandknowledge} related to \glspl{milestone} should also be made \gls{accessible}, as far as confidentiality rules allow for this. Embargo periods are possible but need to be approved by the \gls{tf} on \gls{dataandknowledge} management. Restricted access to the IPBES \gls{data} underlying \glspl{ipbesproduct} is only allowed under special circumstances and needs to be approved by the  \gls{tsu} on \gls{data} and \gls{knowledge} management;

    \item Applicable legal, ethical, privacy and confidentiality, and \gls{data} governance requirements need to be followed and \gls{data} generated, if deemed necessary, anonymised before preservation;

    \item Tools for the finding, processing and final presentation of any \gls{data} should be used in a responsible and ethical manner which is following this policy. No tools should be used without critical assessment of the methods and results;

    \item The management, handling, and delivery of the materials from \glspl{iplc} adhere to the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles to the fullest extent possible as outlined in this policy, as well as to other binding conditions outside this policy in accordance with international, regional, and national law;

    \item \glspl{ipbesproduct} and their metadata are released with a clear and \gls{accessible} \gls{data} use license: allowed licenses for the \glspl{ipbesproduct} are Creative Commons By Attribution (CC-BY\footnote{\href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/} or newer versions} or licenses equivalent to these, which permits users to copy, distribute and transmit work, adapt work under the condition that the user must attribute the work in the manner specified by IPBES. Divergent licences need to be approved by the  \gls{tsu} on \gls{data} and \gls{knowledge} management;

    \item All \gls{knowledgesynthesis} within IPBES have to be conducted in accordance with agreements with the holders of the \gls{dataandknowledge} regarding use, reuse, presentation, and procedures. Communication with \glspl{iplc} needs to be maintained over the whole \gls{task} cycle to the extent possible within the mandate of the Platform and \gls{ipbes} mandate to provide feedback to the \gls{knowledge} holders as well as include feedback from the \gls{knowledge} holders in the \gls{knowledgesynthesis}, as outlined in the IPBES approach to recognising and working with \gls{ilk} as set out in annex II to decision IPBES-5/1\footnote{\href{https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/inline/files/ipbes_ilkapproach_ipbes-5-15.pdf}{https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/inline/files/ipbes\_ilkapproach\_ipbes-5-15.pdf}};

    \item \glspl{ipbesproduct} will be made available and \gls{accessible} to the holders of the \gls{dataandknowledge}, in line with agreed terms documented during ILK dialogue workshops or other activities, with due consideration to the \gls{fair} and \gls{care} principles.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Provisions on the use of advances in data technologies}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \gls{ipbes} does not limit the use of advances in data technology, as long as they are used in a way which is compliant with this policy
    \item Although most \gls{ai} systems present little to no risk and offer solutions to various societal challenges, some systems introduce risks that need to be addressed to prevent negative consequences.
    \item When using \gls{ai} in \glspl{task}, the \gls{ethicaluse} and \gls{responsibleuse} must be guaranteed
    \item Further details as well as scenarios of \gls{ai} use in an ethical as well as responsible way are detailed in the IPBES AI Code of Practice in Appendix \ref{sec:aicop}.
